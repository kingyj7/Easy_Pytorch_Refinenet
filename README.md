# pytorch_Refinenet   

The first intension of this work is to distinguish foreground and background based on RefineNet, see paper at [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06612.pdf).   

## Training   

Generate your train and validation list file, put them to ./lst_file/, and run >python train.py.   

## Reference

The pytorch implementation refers from [thomasjpfan/pytorch_refinenet](https://github.com/thomasjpfan/pytorch_refinenet).   
The organization of training loop and main function refers from [aaron-xichen/pytorch-playground](https://github.com/aaron-xichen/pytorch-playground)

## Eval and Inference code   

Coming soon.
